1. Ilya Berzhanin
2. My email: 19berkut94@gmail.com
3. My aim is to become a high-qualified specialist in Frontend Development. Being satisfied in my work is very important for me. There too many plans and desires in life to realize and I hope working in this sphere can help me to do it. At this moment I haven't finished the courses but I do my best, I am purposeful and never leave the problem until its finishing, always ready to act in stressful situations and rapidly changing conditions, I'm also able to learn great amount of information in short terms.
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
5. I suppose I have no code examples to be proud of now.
6. Unfortenately, I can create only simple pages and modal winds.
7. I am at up-skill-lab course now.
8. As concerns my english level I think it is between B1 and B2 levels and because of lack of speech practice it takes me some time to get used to speak fluently.
